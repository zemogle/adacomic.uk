To celebrate publishing a Ukrainian version of Ada's Adventures in Science we are offering a free copy of Ada's Adventures in Science to anyone (in UK) who donates more than £2. We are using Collection Pot to collect this money and will donate everything collected to the charity Голоси Дітей - [Voices of Children](https://voices.org.ua/en/) which helps children who have experienced trauma.

## Classroom pack

If you donate £25 or more I will post a classroom pack to anywhere in UK for you. This includes 30 copies of the comic book, stickers and educational activities. Please <a href=mailto:hello@adacomic.uk>be in touch</a> with your address or school address. We have 10 of these left - first come, first served!

Ada's Adventures main message is one of hope. That by giving children confidence they can explore the world around them free from prejudice.
