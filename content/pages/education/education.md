Our educational activities have been created for **students in years 5-7**  but they are appropriate for audiences outside that range.

<blockquote>
<h4>Tip</h4>
These activities can be adapted for mixed ability classes. For students with limited reading or writing, the stories can be read out loud, then the creative part can be entirely pictures.

<h3><a href="next">What Happened Next</a></h3>

This activity blends scientific vocabulary, collaboration, creativity and artistic skills. Some students will take part in a performance of the Ada story “Robotic Telescopes: How to find cool stuff in space”. The activity then invites all students to create their own ending for the story in the form of a comic strip or drawing.
