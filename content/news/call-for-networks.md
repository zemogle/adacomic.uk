We are constantly looking for ways to share Ada's message promoting curiosity and inclusion to a wide audience. Thanks to our amazing Kickstarter campaign in 2017, we sent 13,000 copies of the comic in 4 languages around the world. Over 50% of the comics were to kids in the developing world.

Now we are looking for your help to spread Ada in your networks.

We have 2,000 copies of Ada's Adventures in Science (1600 in English and 400 in Welsh) to offer - for free!

So if you are:

- A museum,
- A library,
- a school,
- an independent bookshop,

please be in touch with us. We would love to start a conversation about how we can share Ada's Adventures with your community. We are mostly looking for communities in UK but if you are outside UK and could share postage costs, please be in touch too.
