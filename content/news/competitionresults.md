Congratulations to everyone who entered our [What happened next?](/education/next/) competition. We are pleased to announce that the winning entry is...

![Miruna's entry](/images/Miruna.jpg)

Miruna from Colegiul National Gheorghe Lazar Sibiu in Romania. Her alternative ending was creative and beautifully drawn. It also captured the messages of hope and inspiration that are central to Ada's Adventures.

A prize we sent all of Miruna's class copies of Ada's Adventures in Science, as well as A0 posters of some comic book pages. Miruna herself also received some original art from Laura, who draws Ada.

Congratulations to Miruna and her teacher Daniele Bunea.
