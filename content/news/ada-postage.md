Today Edward posted out all the individual comic books to our amazing Kickstarter backers. 41 went around UK, 15 to the rest of the European Union, 32 to USA, 4 to Canada, 1 to Singapore, 1 to Japan, 1 to Australia, and 1 to Argentina - 92 in total!

The lovely people in my small post office (inside [Cardiff University Students' Union](https://www.cardiffstudents.com)) were very patient and helped to put on all the international stamps. Alice, our intern who is helping with the shipping, put all the UK stamps - AND did all the packing.
