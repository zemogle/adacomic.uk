We are pleased to announce that we can now offer Ada workshops in primary, middle and lower secondary schools in South Wales and South West England, thanks to funding from the [Royal Astronomical Society](https://ras.org.uk).

Each workshop will be a fun mixture of art and science, and emphasise creativity and building confidence for the students. Amongst other content, we will explore the [What happened next?](/education/next/) educational activity. Each student taking part in the workshop will also recieve their own copy of Ada's Adventures in Science.

If you would like your school to take advantage of this opportunity please email [hello@adacomic.uk](mailto:hello@adacomic.uk).

Workshops are subject to the availability of the presenters, distance from Cardiff and on a first-come-first-served basis.
